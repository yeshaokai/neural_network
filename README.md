singleNeural.py is the simplest form of neural network

MLP.py is the base class for Multiple Layer Perceptron Neural Network (has most detailed documentation)

MLP_NonBinary.py is the variance of MLP that generates output that is not between 0 to 1 so it can approximate most real world system

iris.py has the code to test iris dataset

handwriting.py has the code to test mnist dataset. Note that I don't include mnist database in the git repository. It is not going to work if you don't download the database and put it in the same directory

timeSeries.py has the code to test time series prediction using time lags model

RNN.py is the attemp to construct Recurrent Neural Network, which is perceived to be the better model than time lags model to predict time series.
